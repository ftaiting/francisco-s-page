<h1><b>New to This Language</b></h1>
<P>I'm around new cultural barriers and it seems to be a good fit so far. There are many things interesting to the looks and shapes of what I am experiencing in this new culture that it drives me to become more involved. I begin to adjust myself with the elements accordingly while watching my surroundings for any chances of mishaps . I am now able to comprehend <em>a bit </em>with the diversity of different attributes and start to memorize the basics of this new language however, new to this language!</p>
<hr/>
<p>I'm liking the fact that I am able to confidently understand the barriers that was once syntax to me. 
<br> Being that I am more involved only gives me the opportunity to overcome what I want to do or be in this interesting field. As I can only strive to keep learning and collaborating with, the chances of being defeated will be lesser than if I was to just give up! I may roam into an unpredictable outcome one day, but hope that luck will soon find it's way to me!</br><p>
